				<div class="Terrapin_Jumper">		
					In September 2013 I went to my first hackathon, specifically Mhacks. Me and a couple of students from my University built a game similar to flappy jump. However, instead of using a keyboard as input it used facial tracking software to guage whether or not the character should jump. In other words, if you jumped or ducked in real life your character would jump up and down. It was written in Java and if you would like to see the source code you can see it <a href="https://github.com/Terrapin-Jumpers/mhacks" style="font-size: 17px;">here</a>. For more information(including a video) check this<a href="http://mhacks.challengepost.com/submissions/17613-super-terrapin-bros" style="font-size: 17px;"> link out.

				<div class="blind_spot">		
					Over the summer of 2013, I was taking a summer course at my University and as a result I had to drive on the beltway on a daily basis. Normally on those drives I would have to change lanes on the highway numerous times. When traveling at highway speeds you cover some serious distance when checking your blind spot. I didn't think this was safe to do whenever I had to change lanes. So I decided to build a blind spot detector that would alert me with an alarm and flashing leds when someone was in my blind spot. Granted many modern cars already had this feature but my car did not and I thought this would be a fun thing to build. Unfortantenly I don't have any videos of it in action but here is the source code. I'll be sure to get some videos and pictures of it soon.
